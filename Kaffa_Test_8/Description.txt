- This simple Diagram has only two entities, `Clients` and `Products` that has one relationship between them: `Orders`, aswell as each one's attributes as shown in the picture named "MER" in this folder.

- Clients can order none or n products, aswell as products can be ordered by none or n clients.

- The primary keys in the Orders relationship are three: `ID_Client`, `ID_Order` and `ID_Product`. With this is possible to have more than one product per ID_Order.

- For the SQL command to list orders with number of itens, this database was created using Wampserver. The pictures in this folder named "DESIGN", "PRODUCTS", "CLIENTS" and "ORDER" pictures below show its population.

- To list the orders with the total number of items of each order, you can use the following SQL command:


SELECT O.ID_Order, SUM(O.Quantity) AS Number_of_itens`
FROM orders O
JOIN clients C
ON O.ID_Client = C.ID
JOIN products P
ON O.ID_Product = P.ID
GROUP BY O.ID_Order


- The result of this query is the table of the picture named "SQL", it shows every ID order and sum the quantities of the items of each diferent ID regarding each different order.
