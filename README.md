- How do I use this program and what does it do?

  In short, you only have to type a CNPJ number in the input field and click `Confirm`. It will show two dialogue boxes explaining if the given number is in a valid CNPJ format and if its digits valid according to the rules of the Brazil's Revenue Service. `Clear Field` erases the input field and `Exit` terminates the program.
